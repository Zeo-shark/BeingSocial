# BeingSocial
Submission for MLH Selfie Hacks!

# Inspiration 
Hackathons. Pandemic. Lockdown.
Somehow don’t relate,right? Except for virtual ones?
Now,another challenge. Who to work with?
Only options, being a beginner – use team building channels in Discord,Slack,etc.
So far so good,only possibility being entirely unaware of the people who’re posting..how they
But….WAIT!!
What if, there’s a platform, essentially for hackathons?

# HERE COMES THE USE OF QLICKYWID

# What does it do?
We display our work during hackathons,post our selfies with the hacks we’re building. So that,the next time there is an event,some other newbie can go through it,interact with us and team up? Or an experienced hacker can refer it,see if there’s anyone working in their area of interest and socialise with them.
For the design prototype,we used Canva pro and figma,so that we could visualise the concept. The app was entirely made in react.js,since we found it pretty convenient to work with. Since we needed a database to store user data,we decided to use the functionalities of Google cloud to store it as well as Firebase for developing the backend


# Challenges we ran into
Envisioning the logo for the project,connecting the database with the frontend and a few other knick-knacks proved to be small bumps in our road to the implementation of the project;otherwise it was a pretty smooth sail.

# What we learnt
Hackers can team up using the existent methods,or save time by using qlick.it,wherein they can view projects and interact with the makers in real time. It can serve as a gateway to connect diverse hackers all over the world. This,in turn,will be vital in helping to develop their social skills,forging new friendships and aid in their overall mutual growth.

# What's next for this
Our team plans to expand this prototype by including more features,expanding this idea from the hacker community to anyone interested in and believing in the spirit of collaboration and teamwork in achieving success;as rightly said by none other than Henry Ford:
Coming together is a beginning,
Staying together is progress
And working together is success.
