# BeingSocial
Submission for MLH Selfie Hacks!

# Inspiration 
Hackathons. Pandemic. Lockdown.
Somehow don’t relate,right? Except for virtual ones?
Now,another challenge. Who to work with?
Only options, being a beginner – use team building channels in Discord,Slack,etc.
So far so good,only possibility being entirely unaware of the people who’re posting..how they
But….WAIT!!
What if, there’s a platform, essentially for hackathons?

# HERE COMES THE USE OF QLICKYWID

# What it does?
We display our work during hackathons,post our selfies with the hacks we’re building. So that,the next time there is an event,some other newbie can go through it,interact with us and team up? Or an experienced hacker can refer it,see if there’s anyone working in their area of interest and socialise with them.


# Challenges we ran into
Envisioning the logo for the project,connecting the database with the frontend and a few other knick-knacks proved to be small bumps in our road to the implementation of the project;otherwise it was a pretty smooth sail.
