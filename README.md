Coming together is a beginning,
Staying together is progress

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Hackathons. Pandemic. Lockdown. Somehow don’t relate,right? Except for virtual ones? Now,another challenge. Who to work with? Only options, being a beginner – use team building channels in Discord,Slack,etc. So far so good,only possibility being entirely unaware of the people who’re posting..how they But….WAIT!! What if, there’s a platform, essentially for hackathons?

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like teaming up with like minded people,hunting for the perfect team,etc.
* You should be able to team up with fellow hackers,without going through the hassles of requesting a teamup,talking about your tech stack,etc. :smile:

Hence,this social media platform. Just go through posts and works done by hackers earlier,and team up with the ones you like!


### Built With

This section lists the major frameworks that we built our project using. 
* [React js](https://reactjs.org)
* [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com)
* [HTML](https://www.html.com)
* [Canva Pro](https://www.canva.com)
* [Figma](https://www.figma.com)

### What it does
* We display our work during hackathons,post our selfies with the hacks we’re building. 
* The next time there is an event,some other newbie can go through it,interact with us and team up.
* An experienced hacker can refer it,see if there’s anyone working in their area of interest and socialise with them.
That's how simple it is!!

### How we built it
* Design prototype - Canva pro, figma
* The app - ReactJs.
* Db - Google cloud buckets
* Backend - Firestore
